# Codecool Python Course Tasks

This repository contains basic and advanced level Python tasks completed during the Codecool course. These exercises cover various fundamental and advanced concepts in Python programming.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of Python exercises completed as part of the Codecool course curriculum. The tasks are categorized based on their difficulty level and cover a wide range of topics in Python programming.

## Structure

The repository is organized into files based on the task categories or difficulty levels. Here is an overview of the file structure:

- # `Task-Basic.py`: Contains Python tasks focusing on foundational concepts.
  
1. **String Reverser**:
   - Write a program that takes a string as input and returns it reversed.

2. **List Sorter**:
   - Accept a list of numbers from the user and print the sorted list.

3. **Age Calculator**:
   - Ask the user for their birth year and calculate their age.

4. **Temperature Converter**:
   - Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

5. **Simple Calculator**:
   - Create a program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers based on user input.

6. **Word Counter**:
   - Accept a sentence from the user and count how many words it contains.

7. **Days Until Birthday**:
   - Using the `datetime` library, ask the user for their birthday and calculate how many days are left until their next birthday.

8. **Random Number Guesser**:
   - Using the `random` library, generate a random number between 1 and 100 and let the user guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

9. **Simple Alarm Clock**:
   - Ask the user to set a time, and when that time is reached, display a message.

10. **Currency Converter**:
     - Using a third-party library like `forex-python`, create a program that can convert one currency to another based on current exchange rates.
     
- # `Task-Advanced.py`: Contains more complex Python exercises covering advanced topics.

1. **Palindrome Checker**:
   - Write a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

2. **Prime Number Finder**:
   - Create a program that finds all prime numbers up to a given number.

3. **Logbook**:
   - Design a program that acts as a simple logbook or journal. Users can add short log entries (e.g., "Completed Chapter 5", "Attended Python Workshop") that are written into a log file. Display all log entries with timestamps. (Requires: built-in `open` function)

4. **Todo List Application**:
   - Design a simple command-line To-Do list where users can add tasks, mark them as done, and list all tasks. (Advanced: Save tasks to a file so they persist between sessions.)

5. **Text Analyzer**:
   - Create a program that reads a text file and provides statistics like word count, sentence count, most common words, and average word length.

6. **Weather Checker**:
   - Create a program that fetches and displays the current weather for a given city. (Requires: `requests` library and an API like OpenWeatherMap)

7. **Basic Web Scraper**:
   - Design a program that scrapes and prints headlines from a news website. (Requires: `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries)

8. **Password Generator**:
   - Create a program that generates strong passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Allow users to specify the length.

9. **Password Validator**:
   - Design a tool that checks if a given password meets certain criteria: a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and a minimum length. The program should provide feedback on which criteria the password fails.

10. **Dictionary and Thesaurus Lookup**:
   - Create a program that allows users to enter a word and get its definition and synonyms. (Requires: PyDictionary library or an API like WordNet)
